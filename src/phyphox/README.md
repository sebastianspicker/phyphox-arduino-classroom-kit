# phyphox sources

The importable `*.phyphox` files in the repository root are generated from `src/phyphox/*.phyphox.xml`.

The source files use **XInclude** to share common XML snippets (e.g. data container definitions and BLE channel mapping) stored in `src/phyphox/includes/`. The phyphox format does not support fragment includes for parts of elements (e.g. single graph attributes or translation strings), so repeated view/graph attributes and translations remain in each experiment file. Further deduplication would require a custom template or preprocessor; the current XInclude-based approach is the standard for this repo.

## Rebuild

```sh
scripts/build-phyphox.sh
```

CI validates that the generated `*.phyphox` files match these sources.
